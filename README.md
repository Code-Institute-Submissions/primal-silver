~~The site supplyâ€™s a single page view, with link to anchor points. Each section will have a "read more" button to a separate page with more detailed information in comparison to the single page.
The site will offer a description of the company, samples of work, contact and location information.~~

The site will provide a frontpage with information and images about the company. The main navigation bar will be sticky at the to of the page
and provide navigation to more detailed area of the website. All pages will be accesible from every page of the site.
The site is to include a main "hero" section with the page titles in.
